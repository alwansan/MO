# Current status

- Date (Asia/Baghdad): 2026-11-07
- Phase: **P0 PLANNING / RESEARCH**
- Source tree: GitHub alwansan/MO main
- Session ID: `MO-20261107-PLANNING-001`
- Deliverables: project plan, architecture, research, privilege matrix, licensing, restore prompt, source evidence, tests, ADR, session log.
- **No Android application source or APK built. No bootloader/root/ROM changes.**
- Confirmed blocking constraint: iUnlockerGL Zygisk behavior cannot be replicated by merely installing its ZIP with non-root Shizuku.
- Confirmed opportunity: standalone Android app with ZIP inspection/extraction; Shizuku optional ADB diagnostics; conditional ANGLE testing if device supports it.
- Blockers for full original functionality: Android privilege boundary and iUnlockerGL derivative-use license.
- Device tests: not run (no direct device access).
- Next phase proposed: P1 Kotlin skeleton + permission UI + non-destructive diagnostics **after user explicitly moves out of planning**.
- Open questions for actual device validation: Shizuku active UID, ANGLE availability/selection on HyperOS, ability to install extracted app UI normally, effects of OEM security restrictions; none required to complete P0.
- Resume: `prompt/RESTORE_AR.md`.
